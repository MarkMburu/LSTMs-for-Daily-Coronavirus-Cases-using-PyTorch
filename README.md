# Time Series Forecasting with LSTMs for Daily Coronavirus Cases using PyTorch

## Dataset
use this [link](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series) to download the Time series summary (csse_covid_19_time_series) datset.

## Introduction
- Many classical methods try to deal with Time Series data with varying success but In the last couple of years, Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) models have become a very useful method when dealing with those types of data.

- Recurrent Neural Networks are very good at processing sequences of data. They can recall patterns in the data that are very far into the past (or future). In this tutorial, youâ€™re going to learn how to use LSTMs to predict future Coronavirus cases based on real-world data.
